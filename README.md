# GitPlayground

This repository contains a simple C program (`sample.c`) designed as a playground for Git workflows, code experiments, or sandbox development.

## Files

- `sample.c`: A minimal C program demonstrating console output, used for experimentation and testing.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the program, you will need the GCC compiler (or any C99 compatible compiler).

### Compilation

Open a terminal and navigate to the `GitPlayground` directory, then run:

```
gcc sample.c -o sample
```

This command will compile `sample.c` and produce an executable named `sample`.

### Running the Program

After compiling, run the executable:

```
./sample
```

You should see the following output:

```
Hello world Hello Git Hello Github
added this line via KAVIA code maintenance prompt to explore KAVIA AI
```

## Notes

- Make sure you have execution permissions on the output binary (`chmod +x sample` if necessary).
- No external dependencies are required for this sample program.
- This repository is intended for educational and experimental purposes.
